# Decisions

The running log. A decision lands here the moment it is made, with the reason, so no session has
to remember it. Expensive-to-reverse decisions also get an ADR under `docs/adr/`. Nothing here is
edited after the fact; a later decision supersedes an earlier one by saying so.

## The product

- **What it is.** Pages composed on the server from assemblies, each written in one UI framework,
  living either in this project or on another server. Reason: this is the thing the v1 proved and
  the thing nothing else does; server composition of independently owned fragments is the product,
  not server rendering.
- **Who it is for.** A team that wants to hire a React developer, a Vue developer and a Svelte
  developer into one codebase and have each productive on their first day in the framework they
  already know. Every design choice is judged against one scene: two of them pair on the same page
  in their first hour, each in their own framework, and the page composes both.
- **The internal bar**, never used in public copy: it should be simple enough that someone who has
  never seen the framework can assemble a page from parts without a tutorial.
- **No competitor is named or compared against** on any public surface. We describe what we do.

## Vocabulary (fixed; the README defines it, code and docs use it exactly)

Decided one noun at a time. Rule: HTML's own words where HTML already has the thing, machine terms
for structure, data terms for data, nothing invented.

The v1 called these mesh, face, view, preprocessor. Its own word for the server-side data step was
split across two concepts (preprocessor and service); they are one concept here.

## Ruled

- **Rewrite, not a port.** The v1 is read whole as evidence and then set aside. Reason: the v1's
  core cannot start without a bundler's dev server, its quickstart does not complete on a clean
  install, and its composition loop has no failure isolation. Those are architectural, not bugs.
- **Composition:** a page waits for its assemblies, but every assembly carries a deadline and
  declared fallback content, so a slow or dead one degrades instead of blocking or killing the
  page; an assembly may additionally be declared deferred, in which case the page ships a
  placeholder and the browser fills it after load. Owner, 2026-09-03. Reason: the v1 used a bare
  `Promise.all` with neither isolation nor fallback, so one bad child was one bad page.
- **Licence:** Apache-2.0 verbatim, with NOTICE. Copyright line carries no year.
- **Packages:** `@assemblejs/core`, `/cli`, `/create`, `/devtools`, `/renderer-templates`, and one
  `@assemblejs/renderer-*` per framework. Reason: a React team must not install Vue.
- **Everything the mission needs ships in 1.0.** Owner, 2026-09-02. Nothing that the stated
  mission requires is deferred to a later version.
- **Two channels.** Branch `next` publishes prereleases under the `next` dist-tag; branch `main`
  publishes a version exactly once. Reason: npm versions are immutable, so the estate's
  overwrite-in-place practice cannot apply to a package.
- **Publishing** is CI-only through npm trusted publishing (OIDC) behind a reviewed environment.
  There is no publish token anywhere, and no one publishes from a laptop.
- **Style isolation:** an assembly's CSS is scoped by default; Shadow DOM is a per-assembly
  opt-in. The parts that cannot be scoped (keyframes, font-face, imports, page rules) are
  documented as global rather than hidden.
- **Auth** lives in core: basic credentials, an `authenticate` callback, and public routes; boot
  fails loudly when auth is on and credentials are missing. Forwarded to another server's assembly
  only by opt-in.
- **Assemblies from other servers** are allowlisted by exact origin. No wildcards.
- **An assembly is a public HTTP fragment by default**; auth applies when configured.
- **Real-time** is server-sent events through an api handler, delivered to assemblies over the
  events wiring. No WebSocket in core.
- **An assembly may declare named views** (device, locale, experiment) with a selector; one view
  is the default. Reason: the v1 used this in production.
- **Devtools** are development-only and read-only over HTTP. Reason: the v1's rewrite exposed a
  browser-reachable route that ran shell commands.
- **The landing page shows framework names, not third-party logos.** Reason: most framework marks
  require permission for placement on a third-party marketing page, and several forbid recolouring.

## Working practice

- The rules for how this repository is worked live in `CLAUDE.md`; the ledger in `docs/TODO.md`;
  the plan in `docs/PLAN.md`; the reference reads in `docs/dossiers/`.
- Owner, 2026-09-03: nothing lives in a session's memory; check the file, never assume; keep the
  ledger and check tasks off as they are done; do not stray from the plan, and when something
  unexpected forces a change, fix it, log it here, raise it only if the plan's shape changes, then
  pivot and continue.

## 2026-09-03: the reference reads are not published

Expected: the whole reads of the predecessor would live in this repository under `docs/dossiers/`,
because the plan said work roots in its dossier.

Found: the identity gate refused the commit. The dossiers quote the predecessor's package name and
route prefix as evidence, which is exactly what a citation must do. Checking why the gate exists
surfaced the larger problem: the production predecessor is a PRIVATE repository, and these
documents are a detailed autopsy of it, including security findings and production history.

Decided: reference reads stay out of this public repository and live in the private estate
document store. `docs/dossiers/` is in `.gitignore` so it cannot be committed here by accident.
What a contributor needs is the design and the decisions, not an audit of a private predecessor,
and publishing one would expose someone else's code and its weaknesses. The identity gate stays
strict; nothing is excluded from it.

Fix, same day: `.gitignore` alone was not enough, because the gate walked the filesystem and the
dossiers were still on disk. The gate now scans what git TRACKS (`git ls-files -c`, which covers
staged files, so a new file is scanned the moment it could first enter history). Only a tracked
file can be committed, published, or land in a tarball; failing on scratch files that can never
ship teaches people to skip the gate.

Incident logged with it: restoring that scan deleted the gate's own `--self-test` block, and the
flag then printed success without running anything. The three red tests caught it. The self-test
now asserts its own preconditions (the fixture directory exists, the patterns match at least four
fixtures, the publisher fixture is present) and was watched failing with the fixtures removed and
with the publisher fixture removed. A probe that cannot fail is worse than no probe, because it
reports safety.

## 2026-09-03: the design is written, and what it reverses

`docs/DESIGN.md` is the contract, written before any code. It specifies the decisions above
rather than restating them, and it settles every fork the reference reads left open. Four of its
rulings reverse a shape recorded earlier in the planning, and they are recorded here because a
reversal that lives only in the newer document is a trap for the next reader.

- **The placement element is `<sub-assembly>`**, in a page template and as the wrapper in the
  output, the server filling it in place. Reverses the earlier working form, which stuttered.
  Reason for not using the obvious word: `slot` is on the naming rule's taken list, and Shadow
  DOM is a ratified per-assembly opt-in that uses the real `<slot>`, so the framework would ship
  two unrelated meanings of one word. `sub-assembly` is already the ratified word for a nested
  assembly, invents nothing, and satisfies the hyphen a custom element requires.
- **The data an assembly renders with is `data`, not `api`.** `api` is the ratified noun for the
  raw-data endpoint; one word cannot mean two things in the same object.
- **Local assemblies need no declaration.** The filesystem is the registry and the tool generates
  the import module the author never opens. Reverses the earlier shape, where adding an assembly
  edited the author's own server file at marker comments. Reason: the hand-maintained list
  restating the directory tree was the largest single piece of ceremony, and a generator that
  edits the author's source is worse than the ceremony it removes.
- **Services return their data rather than mutating a shared context.** Reason: a mutated context
  makes every service order-dependent and untestable on its own.

Three further rulings the design makes that were not previously recorded either way: a page
template is the whole document and there is no layout concept; routes are a flat table with
parameters; there is no form or mutation machinery, an api takes a POST. Each is in
`docs/DESIGN.md` section 13 with its reason.

## 2026-09-03: the adversarial audit, and the constraints it puts on the design

The defect hunt over the production predecessor ran eight lenses, each finding refuted by an
independent second reader. Raised 74, survived 61: thirteen critical, twenty high, twenty-two
medium, six low. Thirteen fell to refutation, which is the point of the refutation pass.

The finding that matters most is not any single defect but their shape: the architecture is
sound and every failure is at a boundary that was never declared. Four boundaries, four
patterns, and they account for nearly every row. Composition had no isolation and no bounds.
The trust boundary was never stated, so credentials and raw headers crossed it. Configuration
was read from a place that is empty at runtime, so every setting took its default forever and
the security controls keyed on those settings could never turn on. And abstractions were
declared without being wired, so the type system described a system that did not exist.

The design answers each with a section rather than a bullet: configuration is section 4, trust
is section 5, representation is section 6, errors are section 12, and failure isolation with
bounds is sections 3.3 and 3.4. The audit's fifteen imperatives are each traceable into one of
them. That is the audit's real output; the ranked list is the evidence for it.

The audit stays in the private estate document store with the dossiers, for the reason already
recorded: it is a security autopsy of a private repository.

## 2026-09-03: the placement element is two elements, not one

Expected: one custom element serving as both the placeholder an author writes in a page template
and the wrapper the server emits, the server filling it in place. It is the smaller surface and
it was the design's first form.

Found on review: no single word is right in both positions. A placement is nested by definition,
so a name that says so reads correctly in a template and wrongly on the envelope returned by a
bare fetch of `/assembly/<name>/`, where nothing encloses it. A name that ignores the nesting
reads correctly on the envelope and vaguely in a template. The sameness was the constraint
forcing an awkward name, so it was dropped.

Decided: a page template writes `<assembly name="cart">`, which is a directive the server
replaces and never emits, so it needs no hyphen and reads as the plain noun. The server emits
`<assembly-root data-name="cart" …>`, a real custom element, hyphenated as the standard requires,
named for what every framework already calls the element it mounts into. The author writes one
and reads the other, which is the same split every framework has between authored and emitted.

## 2026-09-03: the registration question is what goes to the owner, not the scaffold

Expected: the one front-loaded question would be whether the tool's `new` scaffolds one framework
or two.

Found: that is a template choice, reversible in an afternoon, and the design already has a
defensible answer, so it was decided rather than asked. `new` produces one framework and `add`
brings the second, because the move is the thing worth teaching. The reversal that actually needs
the owner's word is registration: the design recommends that a directory under `assemblies/` is
simply an assembly, with a generated import module the author never opens, replacing the recorded
shape where adding an assembly edits the author's own server file at a marker comment. It changes
the day-one transcript he has already reviewed, it changes what `add` does, and the tool and every
template get built around whichever answer is right.

Consequence for the ladder: B-02 now lands only the package's exports map and build, and the
vocabulary constants move to B-04, where the envelope first needs them. A word still waiting on
the owner is not encoded into six rungs before he has seen it.
